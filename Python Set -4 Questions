1 Convert a decimal number to binary
2. Write a program to find Fibonacci sequence
3. Write a program to find difference between two given dates and time (format of the input will be like time 1 : dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm:ss. Time 2 : dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm:ss)
4. Find factorial of a number
5.  Reverse a given string (don’t use inbuilt methods) 
6.	Now try to develop a call for calculator which perform add, sub, mul and div operations
7.	Create a parent class where it will ask the user input, Validate this and then pass to calculator class , (Basically calculator class will inherit this parent class for getting input numbers and to check if they are valid numbers)
8.	Perform addition using decorators (Here in the Decorator function make sure that numbers are valid)
9.	Write a script that will recursively browse through a directory and list all the files which has the word ‘HCL’ in it. Use regular expression and make this case insensitive
10.	Use lambda and print the square of all even numbers in the range (1 – 100)
11.	Using list comprehension to print the square of all even numbers in the range (1 – 100)
12.	Have a dictionary with random key element and try to sort the dictionary based on the keys of the dictionary
13.	Print all prime numbers in a range say (100 - 1000)
14.	Check if the given string is palindrome
15.	Validate the given ipv4 address
16.	Write a program that validates if the given email is valid
17.	Write a program that validates if the given phone number is valid (Assume +1 234 567 2345 and 234 567 2345 both are valid)
18.	Increment the given ip address by x number,  say if the input is 192.168.3.225 and increment number is 100 then the output has to be 192.168.4.70
19.	Write a program that connect to a device it can be even localhost (use pexpect package) and print all the files in the default directory
